<p>The Political Intelligence Engine is an exploratory project that seeks to build an engine that will aggregate domain-specific information (in this case, UK Politics) in one place, and deliver meaningful insight and value to users who are passionate about the domain.</p>
<p>If you have an interest in UK politics, we're not a bad place to start. You can drill down and learn more about a certain MP, Lord, or Media person who is active in politics. Soon, you will also be able to drill down by issue.</p>
<p>At the moment, much of the data comes from Twitter, but we plan to expand to include many other public data sources. We donâ€™t control the data sources and we have been known to make a mistake now and then, so please enjoy your PIE with care! </p>

<p>With PIE, everyone can have a slice of the action. Would you like a slice?<br>
  You can email questions, comments or input on new features to us at <a href="mailto:pie.pulse@gmail.com">pie.pulse@gmail.com</a> or follow us at <a href="https://twitter.com/PIE_Politics">@PIE_Politics</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23politicalintelligenceengine&src=hash" target="_blank">#politicalintelligenceengine</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23ukpie&src=hash" target="_blank">#ukpie</a>).</p>
