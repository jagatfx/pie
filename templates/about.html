<h3 style="margin:0 0 10px">What is the Political Intelligence Engine (PIE)?</h3>
<p>The Political Intelligence Engine is an exploratory project that seeks to build an engine that will aggregate domain-specific information (in this case, UK Politics) in one place, and deliver meaningful insight and value to users who are passionate about the domain.</p>
<p>If you have an interest in UK politics, we're not a bad place to start. You can drill down and learn more about a certain MP, Lord, or Media person who is active in politics. Soon, you will also be able to drill down by issue.</p>
<p>At the moment, much of the data comes from Twitter, but we plan to expand to include many other public data sources. We donâ€™t control the data sources and we have been known to make a mistake now and then, so please enjoy your PIE with care! </p>

<ul>
 <li>is an analytics tool that helps you map and track the people and debates shaping public opinion</li>
 <li>analyses both mainstream media and social media</li>
 <li>helps you keep track of public opinion that drives the debates and issues</li>
